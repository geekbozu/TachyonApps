introduction: |
  Temporal is a development platform for building scalable and reliable applications with workflow orchestration capabilities. This deployment uses SD card storage for configuration persistence.

description: |
  Temporal provides a powerful workflow orchestration engine that enables you to build resilient applications with durable execution.
  
  This deployment includes:
  - PostgreSQL 16 for persistence (container-local storage for performance)
  - Temporal Server 1.29.1 for workflow orchestration
  - Temporal Web UI for monitoring and debugging workflows
  - Automatic schema initialization and default namespace creation
  - Health checks for reliable service startup
  - SD card mount verification before startup
  - Configuration persistence on SD card
  
  Storage architecture:
  - Scripts and configuration stored on SD card at /mnt/sdcard/temporal/
  - PostgreSQL data kept on container-local storage for performance
  - Requires Storage/sdcard-mount container to be running
  
  Features:
  - Durable workflow execution
  - Event-driven architecture
  - Automatic retries and error handling
  - Workflow versioning
  - Production-ready schema setup
  - Configuration survives firmware updates
