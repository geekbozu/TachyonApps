introduction: |
  Imports emails from one or more POP3 accounts directly into Gmail using the Gmail API. Designed to run as a durable container with persistent storage for tokens, state, backups and logs.

description: |
  This deployment uses a git submodule to keep the upstream source tree intact, and places the `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` at the app root so we can build an image that references the submodule code. Persisted files (credentials.json, tokens, state, backup, logs) are stored on `/mnt/sdcard/pop3-gmail-importer` to survive device reboots and OS re-installs.
