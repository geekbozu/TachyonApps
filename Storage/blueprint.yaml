introduction: |
  This utility ensures that your SD card is properly mounted at boot time, providing persistent storage across firmware re-installs.

description: |
  Some Ubuntu versions may not properly mount the SD card on boot. This container automatically detects and mounts the SD card partition at /mnt/sdcard on system startup.

  Features include:
  - Automatic SD card detection and mounting
  - Creates mount point if it doesn't exist
  - Adds entry to /etc/fstab for persistent mounting
  - Runs on every container start to ensure availability
  - Supports ext4, vfat, and other common filesystems
  
  The SD card partition /dev/mmcblk0p1 will be mounted at /mnt/sdcard.
