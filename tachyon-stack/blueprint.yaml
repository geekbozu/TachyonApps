  This consolidated stack combines the individual TachyonApps into a single deployable Docker Compose stack. It ensures the SD card is mounted and Caddy is up before bringing AdGuard and the remaining services online.

  Use this stack to deploy all applications together and simplify management. Persistent data remains under /mnt/sdcard as in the individual blueprints.
