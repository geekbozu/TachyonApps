introduction: |
  Flux is a completely open, hackable, unopinionated task management engine with built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration that lets humans, AI agents, and automations work together.

description: |
  Flux is your ultimate task management sidekick – a lightning-fast Kanban board that lets humans, AI agents, and automations team up to crush chaos. With built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, your LLMs can jump in and run the show: creating tasks, updating statuses, and keeping everything in sync.
  
  This deployment includes:
  - Flux web interface on port 3000
  - SQLite-based data persistence
  - MCP server support for AI agent integration
  - RESTful API for automations
  - Real-time updates via SSE
  - Persistent storage on SD card for firmware re-install resilience
  
  Features:
  - Multi-Project Kanban Boards: Juggle epics, tasks, and dependencies
  - Task Dependencies: See what's blocked at a glance
  - MCP Integration: Let LLMs list, create, update, or delete tasks programmatically
  - Real-Time Updates: SSE keeps everyone in sync
  - Webhooks: Integrate with Slack, GitHub, CI/CD
  - API-First Design: Full REST endpoints for ultimate control
  - Git-Native Sync: flux push/pull syncs via flux-data branch
  - CLI-First: Full CLI with MCP parity
  - Agent Memory: Task comments for persistent context across sessions
  - Priority System: P0/P1/P2 priorities for agent task ordering
  - Blob Storage: Attach files (images, docs, logs) to tasks
  
  This deployment is configured with persistent storage on /mnt/sdcard for firmware re-install resilience.
