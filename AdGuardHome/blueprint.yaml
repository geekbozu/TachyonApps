introduction: |
  AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover all your home devices, and you won't need any client-side software for that.

description: |
  AdGuard Home operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a "black hole", thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It's based on software used for public AdGuard DNS servers.

  Features include:
  - Network-wide ad and tracker blocking
  - Customizable blocklists and allowlists
  - Built-in DHCP server
  - HTTPS/DNS-over-HTTPS support
  - DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-QUIC support
  - Detailed query logs and statistics
  - Parental control
  - Safe browsing
  
  This deployment is configured with persistent storage on /mnt/sdcard for firmware re-install resilience.
